1. Place knight in next available spot in the first column.
2. Mark current spot, choose one of the possible paths to take 
   (in the L shape), and move to a new spot.
3. Repeat step 2 from the new spot.
Continue until...
	a. If the knight has gone through all the spots (every spot is marked), 
       return true.
	b. If the knight cannot complete all the paths (all possible paths lead 
       to a marked spot), undo the most recent move and choose a new path.
       Repeat until solution is found.

HOW DOES THE MACHINE KNOW WHEN A SOLUTION CANT BE FOUND?
